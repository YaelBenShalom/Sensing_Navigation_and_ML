This library contains several nodes and launchfiles\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{visualization node}} -\/ The simulation visualization.
\item {\bfseries{slam node}} -\/ Implementation of the extended Kalman Filter SLAM
\item {\bfseries{landmarks node}} -\/ A package to detect landmarks and publish their relative locations.
\item {\bfseries{nuslam library}} -\/ library for implementation of the extended Kalman Filter SLAM algorithm.
\item {\bfseries{slam launchfile}} -\/ Launch file for running the visualization for the turtlebot.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Launch {\ttfamily roslaunch nuslam slam.\+launch robot\+:=localhost} to run the robot in the simulator. Slam will use relative x, y positions and landmark ids as sensor information.
\item Launch {\ttfamily roslaunch nuslam slam.\+launch robot\+:=fasturtle.\+local} to run the code on the turtlebot.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{landmark\+\_\+detect launchfile}} -\/ Launch file for the feature detection node. The launchfile takes a simulate argument.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If the simulate is true, it should launch your simulator and the landmarks node and display everything in rviz.
\item If the simulate is false, it should launch the landmark detection node on the turtlebot and display everything in rviz.
\item Launch {\ttfamily roslaunch nuturtle\+\_\+robot landmarks.\+launch} to launch the feature detection node.
\end{DoxyItemize}
