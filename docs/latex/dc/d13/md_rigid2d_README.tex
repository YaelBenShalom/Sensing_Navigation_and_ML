A library for handling transformations in SE(2).\hypertarget{md_rigid2d_README_autotoc_md25}{}\doxysection{Nodes and launchfiles}\label{md_rigid2d_README_autotoc_md25}
This library contains several nodes and launchfiles\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{odometer node}} -\/ Publishes Odometry messages for differential drive robot based on wheel joint states.
\item {\bfseries{fake\+\_\+turtle node}} -\/ A kinematic simulation of a differential drive robot using the Diff\+Drive class.
\item {\bfseries{fake\+\_\+turtle\+\_\+odom launchfile}} -\/ Launch file for making a turtle move in Rviz using turtlebot3\+\_\+teleop. Run {\ttfamily roslaunch rigid2d fake\+\_\+turtle\+\_\+odom.\+launch} to launch the turtle in Rviz, and move it using the {\ttfamily w}, {\ttfamily d}, {\ttfamily x}, {\ttfamily a} letters on your keyboard.
