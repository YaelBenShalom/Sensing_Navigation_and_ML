This package stores the simulator for the turtlebot and SLAM.~\newline
 The simulator simulates the robot kinematics and a sensor that detects the relative x, y positions of landmarks and a landmark id.\hypertarget{md_nurtlesim_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Nodes and launchfiles}\label{md_nurtlesim_README_autotoc_md2}
This library contains several nodes and launchfiles\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape tube\+\_\+world node} -\/ A kinematic simulation of a differential drive robot using the Diff\+Drive class. The node also tracks the ground truth location of the robot.
\item {\itshape tube\+\_\+world launchfile} -\/ Launch file for running simulator for the turtlebot.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Launch {\ttfamily roslaunch nurtlesim tube\+\_\+world.\+launch} to run the simulator.
\end{DoxyItemize}
