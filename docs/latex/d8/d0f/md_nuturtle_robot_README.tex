This package stores the code that interacts with the turtlebot hardware.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Launch {\ttfamily roslaunch nuturtle\+\_\+robot basic\+\_\+remote.\+launch -\/-\/ros-\/args} to view any optional arguments and their instructions.
\item Launch {\ttfamily roslaunch nuturtle\+\_\+robot basic\+\_\+remote.\+launch robot\+:=localhost} to run the node on the local machine.
\end{DoxyItemize}

This library contains several nodes and launchfiles\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{turtle\+\_\+interface node}} -\/ A low-\/level control and sensor routines in ROS.
\item {\bfseries{follow\+\_\+circle node}} -\/ A node that publishes commands that let the robot drive in a circle of a specified radius at a specified speed.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This node contains a service Control, that causes the robot to travel either clockwise (1), counter clockwise (-\/1), or stop (0) -\/ {\ttfamily rosservice call /control}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{basic\+\_\+remote launchfile}} -\/ Launch file for interaction with the turtlebot hardware.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Launch {\ttfamily roslaunch nuturtle\+\_\+robot basic\+\_\+remote.\+launch -\/-\/ros-\/args} to view any optional arguments and their instructions.
\item Launch {\ttfamily roslaunch nuturtle\+\_\+robot basic\+\_\+remote.\+launch robot\+:=localhost} to run the node on the local machine.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{odom\+\_\+teleop launchfile}} -\/ Launch file for making a turtle move in rviz in a circular path or using turtlebot3\+\_\+teleop. In order to make the real robot move, follow the {\ttfamily Real Turtle Instructions} section before launching.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Launch {\ttfamily roslaunch nuturtle\+\_\+robot odom\+\_\+teleop.\+launch} to making a turtle move in a circulat path.

 
\item Launch {\ttfamily roslaunch nuturtle\+\_\+robot odom\+\_\+teleop.\+launch circle\+:=False} to making a turtle move using turtlebot3\+\_\+teleop, and move it using the {\ttfamily w}, {\ttfamily d}, {\ttfamily x}, {\ttfamily a} letters on your keyboard.

 
\end{DoxyItemize}

To activate the real turtle, please follow the following steps\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item SSH into the turtlebot -\/ {\ttfamily ssh ubuntu@\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}turtle-\/name\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}.local}.
\item Launch the turtlebot3\+\_\+bringup launchfile -\/ {\ttfamily roslaunch turtlebot3\+\_\+bringup turtlebot3\+\_\+robot.\+launch}.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{md_nuturtle_robot_README_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysection{Physical Testing}\label{md_nuturtle_robot_README_autotoc_md13}
\hypertarget{md_nuturtle_robot_README_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysubsection{Experiment I\+:}\label{md_nuturtle_robot_README_autotoc_md14}
Driving the robot forward and backward in a straight line several times, and then stopping when the turtlebot is in its initial configuration.

 

 \hypertarget{md_nuturtle_robot_README_autotoc_md15}{}\doxysubsection{Experiment II\+:}\label{md_nuturtle_robot_README_autotoc_md15}
Rotating the robot clockwise and counter clockwise several times, stopping when the turtlebot is in its initial configuration.

 

 

We can see that in reality the robot slips on the floor, so we don\textquotesingle{}t get the same results as in the simulation.\hypertarget{md_nuturtle_robot_README_autotoc_md16}{}\doxysubsection{Experiment III\+:}\label{md_nuturtle_robot_README_autotoc_md16}
Driving the robot in a circle, clockwise and counter clockwise several times, stopping when the turtlebot is its initial configuration.

 

The robot\textquotesingle{}s final configuration was almost equal to the initial configuration, with $\sim$3 cm difference on the y axis.\hypertarget{md_nuturtle_robot_README_autotoc_md17}{}\doxysubsection{Experiment IV\+:}\label{md_nuturtle_robot_README_autotoc_md17}
Try one of the previous experiments again, but try to get either a significantly better or significantly worse result.

I repeated the first experiment, although this one, I didn\textquotesingle{}t reduce the turtlebot\textquotesingle{}s velocity fast enough before the finish point, so the robot crossed the initial position and stopped $\sim$10 cm after it.
